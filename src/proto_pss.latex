\subsection{pss}

The pss protocol consists of a single message type. The message type provides optional encryption alternatives (using Whisper). It also contains information about how it should be routed in the Swarm netowrk, and a topic which determines how the receiver should process the message's content.

\subsection{message structure}

The message type is structured as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
To		Address
Control		byte
Expire		number
Payload		Envelope
\end{lstlisting}
