\subsection{address}

Swarm addresses all content and all nodes with 32-byte hashes. A node address is called its Swarm Overlay Address. It is derived from the public key of the Ethereum account used to operate the node.\cite[section 9.1]{SWARMGUIDE}

To obtain the Swarm Overlay Address, hash the \emph{uncompressed} form of the public key, \emph{including} its $04$ prefix, using the KECCAK256 hashing algorithm. \cite[network/network.go:68]{SWARMCODE} \cite[p. 78]{MASTERINGBITCOIN} \cite{KECCAK}
